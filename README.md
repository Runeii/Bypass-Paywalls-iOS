V2 WIP

TODO
* Fix sites like The Times
* Restore sites like FT (previously working)

NOTE: This is currently tied to a worker I am using for debugging. This worker would theoretically allow me to see what you're browsing! I'm not actively doing that, but I wouldn't recommend using my worker. If you wish to use this app in the meantime, you will need to deploy `/webrequestProxy` to Cloudflare and update the URL. I will tidy this process up as part of go live.
